How course creation works:

1. Give AI content/topic
2. Generate a layout/headings for the course.
3. For each layout decide sub-content structure and what element would be best to display the content
4. keep track of layout being used and ensure its not repeated too often
5. fetch element reference and feed it into the AI
6. combine all sub contents + headings to make final course
